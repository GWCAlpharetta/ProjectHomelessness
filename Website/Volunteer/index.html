            Volunteering is a great way to give back to your community and it is also a great learning experience! It helps you see things from and different perspective and sometimes the people living in the homeless shelters can tell you interesting stories. It really makes you think about how grateful you need to be for what you have because a lot of people can barely afford food off a dollar menu. You also get to put a smile on someone else's face. Studies show that by just a simple smile can make someone's day. Another benefit is it can go towards your community hours for school or a group that you're in. Even if you just go to hand out food you're making a huge impact in your community. Even the little things count.
